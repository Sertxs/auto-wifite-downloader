# Auto Wifite Downloader

Simply put, this script allows you to easily download Wifite without any issues. 
I know this may seem useless; it's just a personal project for me.
I'm learning Python, so I decided to create this.

This script only works on Termux, because why not?

Maybe I'll do something similar for Linux in the future, but who cares?

You can also use this code to download something automatically, like Windows auto-downloads.
